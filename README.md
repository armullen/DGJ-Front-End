**Digital Gardening Journal**
*This app is created to give gardeners a digital place to plan, organize, and document their gardens from year to year.  It solves the problem of having notebooks filled with information with no way to easily recall or search.  It is also more eco friendly with less waste.*

**Technologies Used**
-React front end
-JSX
-Tailwind styling

**Notes**
*This is a two part repository.  There is another for the back end with the same naming convention.*

*I anticipate some learning curve for Tailwind, and authentication for storing individual data*

*Stretch features for the front end include a keyword search bar, a grid to plan garden plots, and authentication*
